### Data Analyzing 
- Step 1: I created a database and tables in the pgAdmin to import CSV files.
- Step 2: I wrote proper queries to answer the questions. You can reach all queries within the repo.
     
    - Query 1: What are total counts based on type?

            SELECT type,COUNT(type) AS type_count
            FROM netflix_data
            GROUP BY type;

    - Query 2: What are the total counts based on type and country?
        
            SELECT type,COUNT(type) AS type_count,country
            FROM netflix_data
            GROUP BY type, country
            ORDER BY type, type_count DESC;. 

    - Query 3: Demonstrate the top 5 countries which have filmed movies most.
    
            SELECT type,country,COUNT(type) AS type_count
            FROM netflix_data
            WHERE type ='Movie'
                AND country IS NOT NULL
                AND country <> ''
            GROUP BY type, country
            ORDER BY type, type_count DESC
            LIMIT 5;

            END AS duration_range,
            COUNT(*) AS movie_count
            FROM netflix_data
